    "# Modeling loan approval using demo data\n",
    "Using [this data](https://github.com/IBMDevConnect/RBSHack2018/raw/master/hackdata/hack_data_v1.zip), this notebook outlines the modeling process to predict whether an applicant will repay their loan, and then make this prediction for new applications. If you are working in Watson Studio, find instructions for loading the data into your project in the `getting-data-clean.ipynb` notebook. Else, you can access the data from the link yourself and load the data using `pd.read_csv()` in ypour jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem statement:\n",
    "\"I need some base models using GTB , RF , SVM or whatever algo of your choice..we have the logistic regression one..\n",
    "This is for first time model developers, I need reference models on different  algorithmns to give them visibility \n",
    "on the impact of the associated hyperparamters...if you could pick any, it helps...preferably python notebook since \n",
    "I will attach WML part to it later..if not , any model is fine..\"\n",

    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Data access\n",
    "2. Data understanding and shaping\n",

    "If you are using Watson Studio, use the _Insert To Code_ function on the left to get your data. Else, load into a pd df as usual."
