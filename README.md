# loan-data-scikit-example

This repo holds a first iteration and base model available for use as an example of SGD and RF classifiers using Scikit Learn.
- *get-data-clean.ipynb* is a short notebook to collect and unpack the dataset, and load it into a project in Watson Studio.
- *data-modeling-clean.ipynb* takes this data and builds these two models.

Any recommendations for improving the model performance, data pre-processing steps, and other pieces very welcome!

Enjoy!
